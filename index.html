                <h3>Running</h3>
                <p>I started running to be healthier and to immerse myself with the outside world. I currently run 3 times a week and have ran a half-marathon and two City2Surf events. I eventually want to be able to run a whole marathon, then be able to run a marathon in the major cities of the world.</p>

            <div class="item text reading">
                <h3>Reading</h3>
                <p>I only started to read recently and I find it to be enjoyable, particularly when I write my own notes and observations. I mainly read non-fiction books and I am currently reading up on books about making money. </p>

                <h3>Strength Training</h3>
                <p>I previously didn't use to enjoy weightlifting, but I am beginning to have fun doing strength training. Its a lot of fun to see how heavy I can lift, and also to show off my muscles to friends and family. Flexing to myself in the mirror is a lot of fun too!</p>
                </div>
            <div class="item text learning">
                <h3>Learning</h3>
                <p>I consider myself to be a continual learner and I want to keep learning new things as quickly as possible. I am currently learning how to do web development, not necessarily to pursue a career, but it might be helpful to have in the future. With each new experience, I learn something from it, so I try my best to experience new things.</p>
